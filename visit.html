                    <h3>Ancient Castles </h3>
                    <p>The existence of Ravenscraig Castle was due to the request put in my Queen Mary of Gueldres in 1460. Over time famalies changed until it eventually came into the possession of the Sinclair Family, who transformed the Castle into the fortress it is today. In the 21st Century the castle is now, no longer used for watching ships by the sea, but now as a site that visitors can go to learn about the rich history that lies behind it.</p>
