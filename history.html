        </div>
        


        <p>The earliest historical events in the vicinity of the town dates back to 596 AD at the Battle of Raith where the Angles fought the alliance of Scots, who had assistance from Picts and Britons led by King Áedán mac Gabráin of Dál Riata. Near the end of the 11th century the Scottish king Malcom the 3rd purchased the shire of Kirkaladunt from the crown lords of Fife. This was then given to the monks of Dunfermline Abbey in generosity to aid the funding of their newly built church which brought income through the residents. </p>

            <p>Once under the control of Dunfermline abbey, a harbour was built around the east burn which gradually led o the growth of the town which started from the harbour and expanded itself into the main street due to the demand of trade received and promoted through the Baltics. Due to the trade, Kirkcaldy evolved with the production of textiles salt planning and nail making. The industrial revolution in the 19th and 20th centuries helped prosper and increase the fame of the town as it saw the introduction of linoleum. Originally developed in the town as floorcloth, this was quickly dominated by the Michael Nairn & Co but did not become popular across a worldwide scale until the beginning of the 20th century</p>

                <h2>Post War Era</h2>
                </div>    
                
                <p>When the 2nd world war ended Kirkcaldy found itself with a shortage of housing. To counter act this new housing estates, and flats were developed in areas such as Sinclair and Link town. To accommodate children of families living in these estates’ primary schools such as fair isle, Dunearn etc were built. Primary schools were not the only ones that changed, new high schools Temple Hall, Balwearie and St Andrews were created, and Kirkcaldy high school was re located to a more ideal place. During the 1950 construction for a new hospital began which was built on top of the Fever hospital and sanatorium, this was done in the hopes of replacing the cottage hospital which was far too cramped and over run for the space it had. During this time a new bus station opened near the town centre, allowing for a new means of transportation to be used.</p>
